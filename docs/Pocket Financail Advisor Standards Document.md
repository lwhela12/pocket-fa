\#\# Overall Impression  
The standards document is well-organized and aligns with best practices for a financial app. It incorporates modern tools (e.g., React/Next.js, TypeScript, Prisma), prioritizes security (e.g., AES-256 encryption, MFA), and emphasizes user experience (e.g., responsive design, accessibility). The integration of AI via the Gemini 2.0 Pro API is a standout feature, promising innovative data extraction and chat capabilities. However, there are opportunities to enhance it by adding details on state management, API design, testing, code reviews, and user feedback mechanisms. Let’s dive into each section.

\- \*\*Suggestions\*\*:  
  \- \*\*State Management\*\*: Specify a solution like \*\*Redux\*\*, \*\*Zustand\*\*, or \*\*Context API\*\*. A financial app may involve complex state (e.g., user data, financial calculations), and a clear strategy will improve maintainability.  
  \- \*\*UI Library Fit\*\*: Verify that shadcn/ui meets the app’s branding and UX needs. Alternatives like \*\*Material-UI\*\* or \*\*Chakra UI\*\* could be considered if customization is a priority.

\#\#\# 1.2. Backend  
\- \*\*Current\*\*: Node.js, Prisma ORM, PostgreSQL.  
\- \*\*Strengths\*\*:  
  \- Node.js is lightweight and pairs well with Prisma for typed database interactions.  
  \- PostgreSQL is a reliable, scalable choice for structured financial data.  
\- \*\*Suggestions\*\*:  
  \- \*\*API Design\*\*: Define whether the API will use \*\*REST\*\* or \*\*GraphQL\*\*. GraphQL could be beneficial for flexible data queries in a financial context.  
  \- \*\*Scalability\*\*: Mention potential use of microservices if the app’s scope expands, ensuring modularity and resilience.

\#\#\# 1.3. AI & LLM Integration  
\- **Core Feature**: Statement Analyzer (PDF upload, parsing, detail view, AI review) — see [docs/STATEMENT_ANALYZER.md](docs/STATEMENT_ANALYZER.md)
\- **Current**: Gemini 2.0 Pro API for data extraction and chat interactions.  
\- \*\*Strengths\*\*:  
  \- Using Gemini for PDF processing and natural language insights is innovative and aligns with the app’s goals.  
\- \*\*Suggestions\*\*:  
  \- \*\*Prompt Engineering\*\*: Add guidelines for crafting effective prompts to ensure consistent, accurate LLM outputs.  
  \- \*\*Response Handling\*\*: Plan for cases where LLM responses are unclear (e.g., fallbacks to rule-based logic).  
  \- \*\*Context Management\*\*: Ensure multi-turn chat conversations maintain context for a seamless user experience.
